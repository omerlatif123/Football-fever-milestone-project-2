## Introduction

I want to create a interactive football themed website, after the Euro's this year I wanted to create something that would capture the happiness and europhia the tournament had brought everyone this summer. Among facts about the tourmanment and locations I wanted to add a mini quiz to test the football knowledge of the user. The user will be given a random 5 questions, worth 10 points a quesiton, if they are wrong the button will display in red and if they are correct it will be green.

## UX

### Visitor goals     

1)	I want to be able to navigate through the website quick and easily. 
2)	I want to be able to access football facts and stats and learn more about the Euro's.  
3)	I want to be able to have fun by playing the quiz, the quiz should be short and simple.  
4)	I want to be able to follow the Football Fever on various media platforms.  
5)	I want to learn about the locations were the tournament games took place. 

### Developers goals 

1)	We want visitors to the site to learn about the Euro's and leave it with more knowledge they had previously. 
2)	we want visiotrs to test their overall knowledge of football by having a euro themed quiz.
3)	We want visitors to have fun, ultimately it is a website they can enjoy in their down time and its for all ages. 
4)	We want the quiz to be simple to access and navigate. 
5)	We dont want to make a long quiz as this may make the visitor lose interest. The quiz should be short and sweet to capitivate the user for long enough but also give them a challenge.   

## Structure 

1)	I want to be able to navigate through the website quick and easily.
    
    The website will have a navigation menu at the top of the webpage, that will allow a visitor to select a heading to direct them to a new page. The heading links also direct the user to the part of the page they want access without them having to scroll down.

2)	I want to be able to access football facts and stats and learn more about the Euro's.

    Instantly when entering the website the visitor will be provided football information. A table of the teams playing in the euro's will provided and further information will be provided about them underneath in Meet the teams section. the facts section will be split into three with information provided about the stadiums, highest goal scorers and best players (in my opinon). At the bottom of the webpage a googple map image will be provided with markers of locations.

3)	I want to be able to have fun by playing the quiz, the quiz should be short and simple.

     The quiz is simple and easy to understand, on entry four options will be provided if the answer is incorrect the answer will temporarly become red if its correct it will be green. The layout is basic witha score tally on the right hand side of the page and on the left side is a progress bar to enform the user on what question out of they 5 they are on. At the end of quiz you are given about to save score or play again. 

4)	I want to be able to follow Football Fever on various media platforms.  
    
    On every page the website footer will have follow us text with icons for Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram. The visitor to the webpage must click on the icons to be taken to their websites.         

5)	I want to learn about the locations were the tournament games took place.

    A google map will be displayed at the bottom of the webpage, with markers of where the games are being held.
    
6)   We want visitors to the site to learn about the Euro's and leave it with more knowledge they had   previously. 
    
    Instantly when entering the website the visitor will be provided football information. A table of the teams playing in the euro's will provided and further information will be provided about them underneath in Meet the teams section. The facts section will be split into three with information provided about the stadiums, highest goal scorers and best players (in my opinon). I wanted to provide enough information to improve the vistors knowledge but not enough to make the lose interest by causing information overload.

7)	We want visiotrs to test their overall knowledge of football by having a euro themed quiz.
    
    All 5 questions are euro related, the questions are about euros past and present. I wanted to give the visitor a challenge so the questions are challegning but not at the standard of mastermind. Everytime the quiz is attmepted again the questions are randomised. 

8)	We want visitors to have fun, ultimately it is a website they can enjoy in their down time and its for all ages. 

I wanted to the website to be simple as possible that the user visit it without having to focus as if they are reading a news website. The colours are bright and have been linked to the theme of a football pitch white and green. The website is very simple to navigate and you dont have to even scroll just click on a nav link that will take you to that part of the page. the football quiz flashing to lure the visitor into playing our quick 5 question quiz. 


9)	We want the quiz to be simple to access and navigate.      
    
    The navbar quiz allows the visitor to access the quiz directly, if they visitor doesnt acess the quiz through the nvabar another option is availble. when scrolling down the webapage a picture of a football pitch with a flashing title play the ultimate football quiz may tempt the user, therefore underneath the picture is a lets play button to direct them to the quiz.   

10)	 We dont want to make a long quiz as this may make the visitor lose interest. The quiz should be short and sweet to capitivate the user for long enough but also give them a challenge. 

With a short attention span myself and a website that focuses on all ages, younger visitors may lose interest on a quiz with as many questions as an exam paper. 5 question with only 4 options to choose keeps the attention of the visitors and makes it tempting for them to complete the quiz rather then a quiz which has over 20 questions.  

     

      
## Skeleton

Wireframe mockups were created in a Balsamic with our clients and potential visitors goals in mind.
Furthermore the images used on the final Football Fever website are free to use images causing no copyright/royalty payment concerns. Some of the images from the wireframes may not have been copyright/royalty free and therefore the imagess have bee covered as a precaution.

# Design

### Colour Scheme
The two main colours used are Green and White as these colours compliment the Football Fever ethos. The colour concept is green and white because this is associated with the colour of a football pitch. I wanted the site to be associated with all things football and this includes the colour theme. I want the visitor to use the website and instantly think football. 

Various shades of the main colours are used throughtout the website, keeping are colour scheme but at the same time preventing the website becoming visually dull. 

 #### Colours used in website background and text.

- ![#fff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fff/000000?text=+) **White** (#fff),
- ![#007bff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/007bff/000000?text=+) **Blue** (#007bff),
- ![##04AA6D](https://via.placeholder.com/15/04AA6D/000000?text=+) **Green** (#04AA6D),

 #### Colours used in grids, containers and other sections. 

![colour-1](assets/readme-files/colour-1.png)
![colour-2](assets/readme-files/colour-2.png)
![colour-3](assets/readme-files/colour-3.png)
![colour-4](assets/readme-files/colour-4.png)
![colour-5](assets/readme-files/colour-5.png)

![colour-7](assets/readme-files/colour-7.png)
![colour-8](assets/readme-files/colour-8.png)
![colour-9](assets/readme-files/colour-9.png)


#### Typography
The headers on all pages throughout the Website and main text use the font ‘Roboto’ with default text of ‘San-Serif’. The header text and parts of the main text are bold catching the user’s eye. We have kept our content at a minimal not to make our website cluttered or to prevent cognitive overload with large amount of information. 

#### Imagery
The imagery chosen fits well within the theme of the webpage as they relate to the subject matter which is football. The imagery used is also visually striking and helps create a better user experience without being overbearing on the rest of the webpage.

## Differences to Design

In the original design, the quiz navbar link would only take you to the section of the webpage which had a button of lets play, this was direct you to the quiz. In discussion with my mentor we realised this was not the most friendly user experience to click a navigation link and a button to reach the quiz. Therfore for a better and faster user experience the quiz links redirects the visitor stright to the quiz and I have also left the lets play button in the middle of the home web page just in case he visitor is scrolling and changes their mind to play the quiz.


### <strong>Features left to implement in the future</strong>


Allow visitor to provide feeback about the webpsite and on completion of feedback form recieve Email confirmation. Currently unable due to time constraints.   

Currently on completion of the quiz the fial score page allows you to type your name and press the save button, currently when save is pressed the visitor is redirected to the home page. In future have on completion of the quiz have a highscores page with names and scores of previous users.In the future will implement this to provide a better user experience.

# Issues and bugs encountered

As a developer I encountered various problems throughout which I have resolved or learned to work around. 


<strong>Navbar menu toggler</strong>- When implementing a navbar menu toggle for when the page is viewed smaller devices the navbar I had already created would not allow me to implement the toggle. When adding the code for menu toggler to my existing code my headers on my navbar for larger screens would shift position and any padding applied would be lost. After researching these issues and asking fellow developers on slack that I discovered the solution. I had to completely restructure my navbar code and start over. The Navbar I have created now is a lot more responsive although slightly different my appearance to the previous navbar, changes to a hamburger toggle when web page is reduced in size. 

<strong>Google map markers</strong>  when implementing Google map JS into my website I encountered various problems, intially I encountered error messages in the console which I rectified as it stated I need to provide my card details. This intially helped but the issue return trying to implement Google markers on to my map. A error message kept appearing in my console with the error refering to the markerclusterers code I had directly taken from the Google Api tutorial page. Even reviewing of Code institute lectures video again regarding maps implementation this did not help either. 

I even researched and asked fellow students on slack but this did not resolve the issue, I was told to create a seperate map.js file to store my code which previously wasin index.html. I have now created a Map.js file which I resolved this issue but this was not to the solution. Finally on further reserach and examing various websites I have restructured by maps.js file, which is now working without issue.

                                
<strong>Colour scheme</strong> This project I struggled to implement a strong colour shceme. Because of  a football theme I wanted to implement colours that will related to the topic (green and white). In reality this was difficult just as finding the correct shade of green and not having too much green that overwhelmed the page. 
After my second meeting with my mentor we discussed adding various shades of green to break up the page. This was implemented all across the website various shades have been added to break up the page. Even the colour for the quiz was kept to the same greens as the home page to keep the theme throughtout the website. Intially the quiz page was a bright blue and red but in discussion with my mentor realised this created seperation from the home page which was a completely diffrent colour. The colour scheme now keeps within the theme of football and is visually appealing. 

<strong>Seperate files</strong>- intially attempted to seperate all my files css and js. The css files were causing issues for example, when the container element required CSS but was linked to the index.html and game.html this would cause problems. On seperation of the the css folders such as having a seperate folder for the game,style and end, this resolved the issue. I also intially had seperated by js files but have created a folder for them as this correct practice.

# Testing

Testing user stories 
   

1)	I want to be able to navigate through the website quick and easily. 

The website has a fixed navigation menu at the top of the webpage, which allows the user the convenience of not having to scroll up constantly to move to another page. The header options allow the user to select a heading to direct them to a new page.

The Navbar is clearly shown in the header of the site and uses a toggler icon for smaller screen sizes. 
When any nav link is pressed it take the vistor to that part of the website rather then having to scroll down. This feature was suggested by my mentor who stated they would prefer to press a link and be transfered direcrtly then having to scroll down.Furtermore the quiz nav link would take the visitor to the part of the webpage where the quiz section was rather then being redirected to the quiz instantly. after discussion with my mentor this was amended.

2)	I want to be able to access football facts and stats and learn more about the Euro's.  

     The website has a table of the team playing in the euro and a description about them in the meet the teams sections. Furthermore the facts section is split into 3 sections which provide information about leading goal scorers, best palyers of the tournament in my opinion and which stadiums the matches were being held in. The location map also give interactive view on the maps of all the locations that matches are being held with the use of markers.

3)	I want to be able to have fun by playing the quiz, the quiz should be short and simple. 
    
    The quiz is simple and easy to understand, on entry four options have been provided, if the answer is incorrect the answer will temporarly become red if its correct it will be green. The layout is basic witha score tally on the right hand side of the page and on the left side is a progress bar to inform the user on what question out of they 5 they are on. At the end of quiz you are given about to save score or play again. 
    
4)	I want to be able to follow the Football Fever on various media platforms.  
     
 The website footer has icons for Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram. The visitor to the webpage must click on the icons to be taken to their websites. In the future  will implement the footer on the other pages, currently footer is causing issues on the other pages, will not sit in position at bottom of page.   
    
5)	I want to learn about the locations were the tournament games took place. 
    
     Google map is be displayed at the bottom of the webpage, with markers of where the games have been held.


6)	We want visitors to the site to learn about the Euro's and leave it with more knowledge they had previously. 

Instantly when entering the website the visitor is provided  a wealth football information. A table of the teams playing in the euro's is provided and further information is provided about them underneath in Meet the teams section. The facts section is split into three with information provided about the stadiums, highest goal scorers and best players (in my opinion). Enough information is provided to improve the vistors knowledge but not enough to make the lose interest by causing information overload.


7)	we want visiotrs to test their overall knowledge of football by having a euro themed quiz.
    
    All 5 questions are euro related, the questions are about euros past and present. The visitor is challenged by the questions. Everytime the quiz is attmepted again the questions are randomised to keep the visitor guessing. 

8)	We want visitors to have fun, ultimately it is a website they can enjoy in their down time and its for all ages.

 The website is simple as possible, the colours are bright and appealling linked to the theme of a football pitch white and green. The website is very simple to navigate and the visitor doesn't have to even scroll just click on a nav link that will take them to that part of the page they require. 

9)	We want the quiz to be simple to access and navigate. 

The navbar quiz allows the visitor to access the quiz directly, if they visitor doesnt access the quiz through the quiz button the navbar is another option availble. when scrolling down the webapage a picture of a football pitch with a flashing title play the ultimate football quiz may tempt the user, therefore underneath the picture is a lets play button to direct them to the quiz.   

10)	We dont want to make a long quiz as this may make the visitor lose interest. The quiz should be short and sweet to capitivate the user for long enough but also give them a challenge.  

 5 question with only 4 options to choose is a simple but at the same challenging.

### Lighthouse Auditing  
I tested the performance of each page through google lighthouse but had issues with the testing and have added a screenshot of the results from fellow students. The reason was due to my internet connection in my area that adversely affected my lighthouse results. 
My initial tests scores were in 80’s and 90’s except for the performance section which was well below 50. 
When examining the lighthouse report further two of my biggest issues were the speed and the TBT (total blocking time). To resolve this, I spoke to my fellow students on slack who advised me to compress the size of my image as this may resolve issue and address why my website loaded slowly. I then used the website TinyJPG to put all my images through to reduce the file size to help the loading process. 

My website was loading a lot faster, and I thought the issue had been resolved, further inspection on lighthouse my performance score only went up by a small amount. Other students who had tested my website had significantly higher scores in comparison to my own. It was not until my mentor meeting that we realised that my local internet connection was tested on Fast.com which highlighted it was considerably slower in comparison to my mentor's internet connection (who had a good lighthouse test result for my website). 
Due to my slow internet connection, I cannot properly utilise lighthouse so therefore I have attached images of lighthouse test reports which have been provided by fellow students.

### <strong>Further Testing</strong>

I have tested the site across different browsers incluing, Google Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. 

I have also tested the responsiveness of the website on dev tools which has help address issues which I was previously having on this project.

### <strong>User testing</strong>

Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues. 
It was through this testing that the following changes were made:

•	Address the overflow issue which was causing the webpages to move while scrolling down. It was fellow student that informed me about unicorn revealer to work out where on my webpages I had overflow. 

•	My images were loading too slowly and may be too big, I used tiny.JPG to address this issue as mentioned by a fellow student. 

•	The make a booking button on the home page when pressed would transfer to contact us page. A fellow student suggested that when pressed the button should directly take the user the booking form rather then having to scroll down in the contact us page to get to the form. 


# Deployment
 
I created the repository using the following steps:

1.	Logging in to my GitHub account and opening the relevant repository.
2.	Click on the settings button, located just above the green GITPOD button.
3.	Scroll down the Settings page to the "GitHub Pages" section.
4.	Under "Source" click the drop-down menu labelled "None" and select "Master Branch".
5.	Upon selection, the page will automatically refresh meaning that the website is now deployed.
6.	Scroll back down to the "GitHub Pages" section to retrieve the deployed link.

Forking the GitHub Repository

Forking a repository enables us to make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account so we can view it and make changes without affecting the original work. This is done using the following steps:

1. Log into GitHub or create an account.
2. Locate the GitHub Repository.
3. At the top of the repository, on the right side of the page, select "Fork"
